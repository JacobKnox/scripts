# Scripts
Random scripts I've written for random reasons.

## [Installer](https://github.com/JacobKnox/scripts/tree/main/Installer)
A simple installation Batch script that installs programs from Winget (programs.txt) and Python packages (pip.txt). I wrote this because there have been multiple occasions where I've had to start from scratch due to my computers crashing or getting a new computer and it got frustrating. This is the start of my attempts to begin automating the setup of my workflow(s).
